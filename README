This repository contains all necessary files for the CuSE System Level Design Lab.
The code here does not work on it's own, SoCRocket needs to be installed with the media and pysc repositories enabled.

The instruction below are valid for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS only. New distributions might need additional work.

To use the models provided in this repository you need the following packages installed:
libsdl1.2-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libavformat-dev libavdevice-dev libavfilter-dev libswscale-dev

libav should be at most version 9, newer version can be problematic. 
To be able to build and link the libav, the following packages are needed: yasm, zlib1g, libasound

Before running './waf configure' export the installation paths of those libraries:
export AV_HOME="/usr/"
export SDL_HOME="/usr/"
